# VideoStore ðŸ“¼  Refactoring Exercise

This repository contains the code / starting point for the [Refactoring](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/refactoring/nodejs/) exercise as part of the [Cloud Curriculum Materials](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/).

## Overview

The repository provides a `videostore` module comprising classes for `Customer`, `Movie`, and `Rental`.

Actual classes can be found in the `lib` folder.

Test code can be found in the `test` folder.

The main entry point is the `index.js` file.

## Getting Started

Please run:

 - `npm install` to install the required dependencies
 - `npm runt lint` to check for linting errors
 - `npm run test` to run the tests and to get a test coverage report
 - `npm run watch` to watch for changes and run the tests automatically when any changes are being detected

## Configuration

The following configuration files are being used:

 - `.editorconfig` for [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to ensure consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs
 - `.eslintrc` for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to find and fix problems in JavaScript code
